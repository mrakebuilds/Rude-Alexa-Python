First Insert The Entire Folder Into Your Python Folder Via These Steps:
1. Open Start Menu
2. Type Run (or search for the program called run and open it)
3. In the Run search bar, type in: %appdata%
4. It will open a folder in AppData called Roaming
5. Go back once and you will see the options: Local, Locallow, and Roaming
6. Open the Local Folder
7. Scroll down and open the Programs folder
8. Open the Python folder and select the python folder version you want to use. For example 'Python 36' (I believe it works best on Python 3 and up)
9. Open the Scripts folder
10. Copy and paste (or simply move) the entire 'Rude-Alexa-Python-master' into the scripts folder
11. When you open VS Code, choose the 'Open Folder' option
12. Copy the folder location where you pasted the folder (where it says "AppData>Local>Programs... etc)
13. Paste it in VS Code's location bar and select and open the 'Rude-Alexa-Python-master' folder
14. Click rudealexa.py to your left to view and run the code

Install These Before Running Code:
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyaudio
pip install gtts
pip install playsound



if 'pip install pyaudio' does not work try:
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio



If you get an error message saying "'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command..." or "the term 'pip' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet..." install like this:
py -m pip install SpeechRecognition
py -m pip install pipwin
py -m pipwin install pyaudio
py -m pip install gtts
py -m pip install playsound
